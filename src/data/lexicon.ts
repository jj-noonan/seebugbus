 * Tag -> position in attribute space.

 * This is the recommendation signal, and the one part of the pipeline that is
 * deliberately hand-authored: MusicBrainz's community tags tell us *what* a
 * record is filed under, not what it sounds like. Mapping those tags onto the
 * axes by hand is what lets the engine say "sparser and stranger" instead of
 * "also tagged post-punk".
 *
 * It lives in TS rather than in the crawler on purpose — tuning it is a
 * hot-reload away instead of a re-crawl away.
 *
 * Every value is 0..1 on that axis. Omitted axes contribute nothing (so a tag
 * only asserts what it actually implies). `era` is never set here; it comes
 * from the release year.
