            The two offers are never picked independently — the pair is chosen to
            maximise the distance <em>between</em> them, because two good roads

            How far each step travels. It sets a <em>target</em> distance, not a
            maximum, so turning it up moves both offers outward rather than just
            spreading them. Novelty rides along with it: reaching further also
            means reaching past the canon.

          <h3>Where the records come from</h3>
          <p>
            Crawled from <a href="https://musicbrainz.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">MusicBrainz</a> and
            the <a href="https://coverartarchive.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Cover Art Archive</a>,
            organised as eleven walkable lineages — krautrock through post-punk to
            early techno, spiritual jazz through sampling-era hip-hop, and so on.
            Each is sampled across popularity <em>and</em> decade, so the canon and
            the deep cuts both show up and no era swamps the rest.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every album is placed on seven axes — era, energy, density, brightness,
            organic↔electronic, conventional↔experimental, instrumental↔vocal —
            mapped by hand from its tags. Hover any cover to see which of those
            moved, and why it's being offered.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h3>Two scores behind every choice</h3>
          <p>
            <b>Popularity</b> is how many separate people reached for a record,
            not how many plays it has — raw plays are dominated by whoever put
            something on two hundred times.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Quality</b> is devotion: listens per listener, boosted by the
            MusicBrainz community rating where one exists. It separates records
            people return to from records people tried once — Burial's
            <em> Untrue</em> draws 48 plays per listener where a chart hit with
            more total plays draws 10.
          </p>
          <p>
            The dial moves both. Turned down it aims at records people know;
            turned up it aims at the tail — and leans <em>harder</em> on quality
            as it goes, because out there devotion is the only thing separating
            a lost classic from a nobody's demo.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h3>Search</h3>
          <p>
            Searching something the catalog lacks isn't a dead end: it's looked up
            live in MusicBrainz, and if it exists it's fetched and added on the
            spot. Press <kbd>/</kbd> from anywhere, and <kbd>tab</kbd> to accept
            the completion.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Telling it when it's wrong</h3>
          <p>
            The three marks under the case rate what you're looking at:{' '}
            <kbd>g</kbd> good call, <kbd>m</kbd> fine but not for you,{' '}
            <kbd>x</kbd> wrong turn. They take effect immediately — a rejected
            record is pushed down the next time it comes up, and hardest of all
            in the same position it was wrong in, since a record can be right
            after one thing and wrong after another.
