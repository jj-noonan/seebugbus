# This used to ask `pgrep -f "bin/python -u <script>"` whether the job was
# already up. It never matched: a venv python is a shim, and macOS reports
# argv[0] as the resolved framework path (.../MacOS/Python), so the string
# "bin/python" is absent from the command line the supervisor was searching.
# The guard therefore read "not running" every time and started another worker
# each minute. Eighteen were live against a 1 req/sec API before it was caught.
#
# Holding the PID removes the guesswork: `kill -0` asks the kernel about this
# exact child instead of asking a text search about a process that resembles
# it. It also cannot match the supervisor, the monitor, or a shell whose
# command line happens to contain the script name.
