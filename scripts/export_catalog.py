A stopgap by design: the app loads the whole catalog into the bundle, which
stops being viable in the tens of thousands. Until the API exists, the export
is capped and takes the most-listened albums, so a huge crawl still yields a
usable app instead of an unloadable one.

    Popularity is distinct listeners, not plays — plays are dominated by
    whoever put a record on two hundred times, while the number of separate
    people who reached for it is what the word actually means.

    Quality blends two things:

      devotion — listens per listener. It cleanly separates records people
        return to from records people tried once: Burial's Untrue scores 48
        plays per listener against Skrillex's 9.9, despite similar totals. It
        is shrunk toward the catalog mean by listener count, so an album with
        one obsessive listener doesn't outrank a classic.

      rating — the MusicBrainz community score, where it exists. Authoritative
        but sparse and expensive to collect, so it is a bonus on top of
        devotion rather than the basis.

    Both are percentile-ranked, which self-calibrates as the catalog grows and
    always spans the full range.
